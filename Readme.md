# Project Name

## Description

This project implements a secure authentication and authorization system for user management using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It allows users to create accounts, log in, and perform authorized actions within the application.

## Features

1. **User Authentication and Account Creation:**

   - Users can create accounts, and upon successful creation, a JWT is issued for subsequent authentication.

2. **User Login:**

   - Authentication is performed by issuing JWTs upon user login.

3. **JWT Decoding and Verification:**

   - JWTs are decoded and verified on the server side using a secure secret key.

4. **Forgot Password and OTP:**

   - Users can initiate a password reset using a randomly generated OTP sent to their email or provided mobile number.

5. **Token Expiry and Session Management:**

   - JWTs have a defined expiration time, and the system automatically expires tokens after a specified session duration.

6. **Logging and Auditing:**

   - Events, such as user logins and critical actions, are recorded for auditing purposes.

7. **Token Revocation:**
   - Users can revoke their tokens to enhance security.
